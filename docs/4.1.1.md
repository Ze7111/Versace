  - There is very little support for this feature at the moment, but it will be improved in the future
  - You can exit interactive mode by running `exit()`
  - It does allow to run python code in interactive mode
  - There is no scope support in interactive mode, meaning there is no context to code, and it sees each line as a new line

## Removed
- Removed the `|` argument separator, you can now use `<` instead
- Removed the `//` working in the middle of a line, you can now use `////` instead to add a // in the middle of a line or a string

## Broken
- As of now music is broken.

- If you are updating from versace 3.0.1 or lower you will need to update your code to work with the new syntax changes
  - You will need to change all `|` to `<`
