## What is programming?
- Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to follow. These instructions are called code. Code is written in a programming language. There are many different programming languages. The most popular ones are `Python`, `Java`, `C++`, and `C#`.
  
- The code you write is called a program. A program is a set of instructions that tell the computer what to do. The computer follows the instructions in the program one at a time. The computer does what the program tells it to do. The computer does not understand English. It only understands code. The computer does not understand what you want it to do. It only understands what the program tells it to do.

## What is a programming language?
- A programming language is a set of rules that tell the computer how to understand code. The rules of a programming language are called syntax. The syntax of a programming language is like the grammar of a language. The grammar of a language tells you how to write sentences. The syntax of a programming language tells you how to write code. The syntax of a programming language is like the alphabet of a language. The alphabet of a language tells you what letters to use. The syntax of a programming language tells you what characters to use.

## What are the different types of programming languages?
- For this we will only be using 4 mopst common types of programming languages
- The different types of programming languages are:
1) Low-level programming languages (also called machine languages) 
   - These are the languages that are closest to the machine code that the computer understands. These languages are very difficult to use. They are also very fast. They are used to write operating systems and device drivers.
   - A few notable low-level programming languages are: `Assembly`, and `COBOL`.
  
2) High-level programming languages (also called general-purpose languages)
   - These are the languages that are furthest from the machine code that the computer understands. These languages are very easy to use. They are also very slow. They are used to write most programs.
   - A few notable high-level programming languages are: `Python`, `Java`, `C#`, and `JavaScript`.
  
3) Scripting programming languages (also called interpreted languages)
   - These are the languages that are somewhere between low-level and high-level programming languages. These languages are easy to use. They are also fast. They are used to write programs that are run by other programs.
   - A few notable scripting programming languages are: `Python`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`, and `Ruby`.

4) Object-oriented programming languages (also called OOP languages)
   - These are the languages that are somewhere between low-level and high-level programming languages. These languages are easy to use. They are also fast. They are used to write programs that are run by other programs.
   - A few notable object-oriented programming languages are: `Python`, `Java`, `C#`, `C++`, and `JavaScript`.

## What is a programming environment?
- An programming environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development
- An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.
- Examples:
    - `Pyhton IDLE`
    - `JetBrains PyCharm`
    - `Java IDE`
    - `Quick C#`
      - And many more

## What is a programming editor?
- A programming editor is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development
- A programming editor normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.
- Examples:
  - `Visual Studio Code`
  - `Visual Studio`
  - `Atom`
  - `Sublime Text`
    - And many more

## What is a programming framework?
- A framework in programming is a tool that provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized in order to speed up development. A framework may include a library, but is defined by the principle of inversion of control (IoC)
- Examples:
  - `Rails` (Ruby)
  - `Django` (Python)
  - `Laravel` (PHP)
  - `Spring` (Java)
  - `ASP.NET` (C#)
  - `Express` (JavaScript)
    - And many more

## What is a programming library?
- A library in programming is a tool that provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized in order to speed up development. A library may include a framework, but is defined by the principle of inversion of control (IoC)
- Examples:
    - `Numpy` (Python)
    - `Pandas` (Python)
    - `Studio.h` (C++)
    - `iostream` (C++)
    - `System` (C#)
    - `React` (JavaScript)
      - And many more
  
## How do I get started with programming?
- You first need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a programming editor. You can use any IDE or programming editor you want. I recommend using `Visual Studio Code` or `PyCharm`. You can download them from the links below:
  - `Visual Studio Code` - https://code.visualstudio.com/
  - `PyCharm` - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

- You also need a programming language. You can use any programming language you want. I recommend using `Python` or `C#`. You can download them from the links below:
  - `Python` - https://www.python.org/downloads/
  - `C++` - https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/
  
- You also need a programming framework. You can use any programming framework you want. I recommend using `Django` or `ASP.NET`. You can download them from the links below:
    - `Django` - https://www.djangoproject.com/download/
    - `ASP.NET` - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework

## Basics of programming
### Variables
- A variable is a container for a value, which can be of various types. Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.

#### How to set variables in Python:
```python
variable_name = value
```
#### How to set variables in C++:
```cpp
type variableName = value;
```
#### How to set variables in Java:
```java
variable_name = value;
```
#### How to set up variables in Verscae:
```swift
variable_name = value
```

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
name = "John"
```
```cpp
// C++
string name = "John";
```
```java
// Java
String name = "John";
```
```swift
// Verscae
name = "John"
```

# 
### Data Types
- A data type is a classification identifying one of various types that data can have. A data type tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. The data type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted. The data type also specifies the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored.

- There are 3 main data types in programming:
  - `Primitive Data Types`
  - `Composite Data Types`
  - `Abstract Data Types`
- There are 4 main primitive data types in programming:
  - `Integer`
  - `Float`
  - `Boolean`
  - `String`
- There are 2 main composite data types in programming:
  - `Array`
  - `Object`
- There are 2 main abstract data types in programming:
  - `List`
  - `Dictionary`

#### How to set data types in Python:
```python
variable_name: data_type = value
```
#### How to set data types in C++:
```cpp
type variableName: data_type = value;
```
#### How to set data types in Java:
```java
data_type variable_name = value;
```
#### How to set up data types in Verscae:
```swift
variable_name: data_type = value
```

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
name: str = "John"
```
```cpp
// C++
string name: str = "John";
```
```java
// Java
String name = "John";
```
```swift
// Verscae
name: str = "John"
```

# 
### Functions
- A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.

- You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.
  - Function blocks begin with the keyword `def` followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).
  - Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.
  - The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.
  - The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.
  - The statement `return [expression]` exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.
#### How to set functions in Python:
```python
def function_name():
    # code
```
#### How to set functions in C++:
```cpp
type function_name() {
    // code
}
```
#### How to set functions in Java:
```java
type function_name() {
    // code
}
```
#### How to set functions in Verscae:
```swift
func function_name() {
    // code
}
```

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
```
```cpp
// C++ (dont forget you need to include iostream)
void say_hello() {
    std::cout << "Hello!";
}
```
```java
// Java
void say_hello() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
}
```
```swift
// Verscae
func say_hello() {
    out < "Hello!" | newl | red
}
```

# 
### Classes
- A class is a blueprint for the object. We can think of class as an sketch of a parrot with labels. It contains all the details about the name, colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the parrot. Here, a parrot is an object.

- An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.

- When the class is instantiated (i.e. an object is created), the class is copied into memory. This process is called instantiation. At this time, memory is allocated.

  
#### How to set classes in Python:
```python
class class_name:
    # code
```
#### How to set classes in C++:
```cpp
class class_name {
    // code
}
```
#### How to set classes in Java:
```java
class class_name {
    // code
}
```
#### How to set up classes in Verscae:
```swift
class class_name {
    // code
}
```

#
#### Examples:
```python
# Python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```
```cpp
// C++
class Person {
    public:
        string name;
        int age;
};
```
```java
// Java
class Person {
    public String name;
    public int age;
}
```
```swift
// Verscae
class Person {
    func init(name, age) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
}
```

# 
### Objects
- An object is an instance of a class. An object contains an internal data representation and defines methods that can operate on that data.

- Objects are the most basic units of object-oriented programming and represent the building blocks of OO applications. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.

- An object is an instance of a class. A class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

- When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class. Each object contains an independent copy of the variables defined in the class. However, when an object modifies a variable that is defined in the class, the class variable is modified.

- Objects are created using the constructor of the class. This invokes an init method. You can think of a class as a sketch (prototype) of a parrot with labels. The information in the labels is stored as attributes. The example for a parrot class is defined below.

#### How to set objects in Python:
```python
object_name = class_name()
```
#### How to set objects in C++:
```cpp
class_name object_name;
```
#### How to set objects in Java:
```java
class_name object_name = new class_name();
```
#### How to set up objects in Verscae:
```swift
object_name = class_name()
```

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
p1 = Person("John", 36)
```
```cpp
// C++
Person p1;
```
```java
// Java
Person p1 = new Person();
```
```swift
// Verscae
p1 = Person()
```

# 
### Inheritance
- Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it. The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class).
- 
#### How to set inheritance in Python:
```python
class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
    # code
```
#### How to set inheritance in C++:
```cpp
class DerivedClassName : public BaseClassName {
    // code
}
```
#### How to set inheritance in Java:
```java
class DerivedClassName extends BaseClassName {
    // code
}
```
#### How to set up inheritance in Verscae:
```swift
class DerivedClassName : BaseClassName {
    // code
}
```

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname

    def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
```
```cpp
// C++
class Person {
    public:
        string firstname;
        string lastname;
        void printname() {
            cout << firstname << " " << lastname;
        }
};
```
```java
// Java
class Person {
    public String firstname;
    public String lastname;
    public void printname() {
        System.out.println(firstname + " " + lastname);
    }
}
```
```swift
// Verscae
class Person {
    func init(firstname, lastname) {
        self.firstname = firstname
        self.lastname = lastname
    }
    func printname() {
        out < f"{self.firstname} {self.lastname}" | newl | red
    }
}
```

# 
### Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

- To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variable. If you want to allow the outside world to read or modify the value of a private member, you can provide public get and set methods.

- Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.

#### How to set encapsulation in Python:
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__hiddenVariable = 0

    def add(self, increment):
        self.__hiddenVariable += increment
        print(self.__hiddenVariable)
```
#### How to set encapsulation in C++:
```cpp
class MyClass {
    private:
        int hiddenVariable = 0;
    public:
        void add(int increment) {
            hiddenVariable += increment;
            cout << hiddenVariable;
        }
};
```
#### How to set encapsulation in Java:
```java
class MyClass {
    private int hiddenVariable = 0;
    public void add(int increment) {
        hiddenVariable += increment;
        System.out.println(hiddenVariable);
    }
}
```
#### How to set up encapsulation in Verscae:
```swift
class MyClass {
    func repr(self):
        self.__hiddenVariable = 0

    func add(self, increment):
        self.__hiddenVariable += increment
}
```

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__age = 0

    def add(self, increment=1):
        self.__age += increment
        print(self.__age)
```
```cpp
// C++
class MyClass {
    private:
        int age = 0;
    public:
        void add(int increment=1) {
            age += 1;
            cout << age;
        }
};
```
```java
// Java
class MyClass {
    private int age = 0;
    public void add(int increment=1) {
        age += 1;
        System.out.println(age);
    }
}
```
```swift
// Verscae
class MyClass {
    func repr(self){
        self.__age = 0
    }

    func add(self, increment=1) {
        self.__age += increment
    }
}
```

# 
### Polymorphism
- Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

- Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

- Polymorphism is an important concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the use of a single type entity (method, operator or object) to represent different types in different scenarios.

- Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

- Any Python object can behave like a string, a list, a dictionary, or a number, depending on how we use it. This is called polymorphism.

#### How to set polymorphism in Python:
```python
class class_name:
    def method_name(self):
        # code
```
#### How to set polymorphism in C++:
```cpp
class class_name {
    public:
        void method_name() {
            // code
        }
};
```
#### How to set polymorphism in Java:
```java
class class_name {
    public void method_name() {
        // code
    }
}
```
#### How to set up polymorphism in Verscae:
```swift
class class_name {
    func method_name() {
        // code
    }
}
```

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def talk(self):
        print(f"Hi, I am {self.name}")
```
```cpp
// C++
class Person {
    public:
        string name;
        void talk() {
            cout << "Hi, I am " << name;
        }
};
```
```java
// Java
class Person {
    public String name;
    public void talk() {
        System.out.println("Hi, I am " + name);
    }
}
```
```swift
// Verscae
class Person {
    func init(name) {
        self.name = name
    }

    func talk() {
        out < f"Hi, I am {self.name}" | newl | red
    }
}
```

### Abstraction
- Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.

- Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.

- Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and require subclasses to provide implementations for the abstract methods.

- Interfaces contain only abstract methods. When a class implements an interface, all of the methods in the interface must be defined in the class.

- Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def talk(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")
```
```cpp
// C++
class Animal {
    public:
        string name;
        void talk() {
            throw "Subclass must implement abstract method";
        }
};
```
```java
// Java
abstract class Animal {
    public String name;
    public abstract void talk();
}
```
```swift
// Verscae
class Animal {
    func init(name) {
        self.name = name
    }

    func talk() {
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")
    }
}
```

# 
### String Interpolation
- String interpolation is a way to construct a new string from a literal template and a set of expressions, which can include variables, literals, object properties, and function calls.

### Examples:
```python
# Python
name = "John"
print(f"Hello, {name}")
```
```cpp
// C++
string name = "John";
cout << "Hello, " << name;
```
```java
// Java
String name = "John";
System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
```
```swift
// Verscae
name = "John"
out < f"Hello, {name}" | newl | red
```

# 
### String Formatting
- String formatting is a technique for making complex strings more readable and easier to work with.

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
name = "John"
print("Hello, {}".format(name))
```
```cpp
// C++
string name = "John";
cout << "Hello, " << name;
```
```java
// Java
String name = "John";
System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
```
```swift
// Verscae
name = "John"
out < f"Hello, {name}" | newl | red 
// There is no string formatting in Verscae, but you can use string interpolation instead.
```

# 
### String Methods
- String methods are built-in methods that you can use on strings.
- String methods are used to perform operations on strings.
- String methods are used to manipulate strings.
- String methods are used to change strings.

#### Examples:
```python
# Python

print(name.lower())
```
```cpp
// C++
string name = "John";
cout << name.lower();
```
```java
// Java
String name = "John";
System.out.println(name.toLowerCase());
```
```swift
// Verscae
name = "John"
out < f"{name.lower()}" | newl | red
```

### Arrays, Lists, and Dictionaries
- Arrays, lists, and dictionaries are data structures that are used to store collections of data.
- A Array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
- A List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.
- A Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.

#### How to set up arrays, lists, and dictionaries in Python:
```python
array_name = [item1, item2, item3]
list_name = [item1, item2, item3]
dictionary_name = {key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3}
```
#### How to set up arrays, lists, and dictionaries in C++:
```cpp
array_name = {item1, item2, item3}
list_name = {item1, item2, item3}
dictionary_name = {key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3}
```
#### How to set up arrays, lists, and dictionaries in Java:
```java

} 
else if number < 10 {
    out < "Number is less than 10" | newl | red
} 
else {
    out < "Number is equal to 10" | newl | red
}
```

### While Loops
- While loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.
- While loops are similar to for loops, but they are used when you don't know how many times you want to loop through a block of code.
- While loops are used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.

#### How to set up while loops in Python:
```python
while condition:
    # do something
```

while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```
#### How to set up while loops in Verscae:
```swift

    // Code
}
```

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
while number < 10:
    print(number)
    number += 1
```
- The while loop is used to execute a block of code multiple times.

```cpp
// C++
while (number < 10) {
    cout << number;

while number < 10 {
    out < f"{number}" | newl | red
    number += 1
}
```

### Try, Except, and Finally Statements
- Try statements are used to test a block of code for errors.
- Except statements are used to handle the error.
- Finally statements are used to execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

#### How to set up try, except, and finally statements in Python:
```python
try:
    # do something
except:
    # do something
finally:
    # do something
```
#### How to set up try, except, and finally statements in C++:
```cpp
try {
    // code block to be executed
} catch (exception) {
    // code block to be executed
} finally {
    // code block to be executed
}
```
#### How to set up try, except, and finally statements in Java:
```java
try {
    // code block to be executed
} catch (exception) {
    // code block to be executed
} finally {
    // code block to be executed
}
```
#### How to set up try, except, and finally statements in Verscae:
```java
try {
    // Code
} 
catch (exception) {
    // Code
} 
finally {
    // Code
}
```

#### Examples:
```python
# Python
try:
    print(x)
except:
    print("An exception occurred")
finally:
    print("The 'try except' is finished")
```
- The try block will generate an exception, because x is not defined.

```cpp
// C++
try {
    cout << x;
} catch (exception) {
    cout << "An exception occurred";
} finally {
    cout << "The 'try except' is finished";
}
```
- The try block will generate an exception, because x is not defined.

```java
// Java
try {
    System.out.println(x);
} catch (exception) {
    System.out.println("An exception occurred");
} finally {
    System.out.println("The 'try except' is finished");
}
```
- The try block will generate an exception, because x is not defined.

```java
// Verscae
try {
    out < f"{x}" | newl | red
} 
catch (exception) {
    out < "An exception occurred" | newl | red
} 
finally {
    out < "The 'try except' is finished" | newl | red
}
```
