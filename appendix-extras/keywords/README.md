* `method` - Allows you to create a method, which works in a similar way to a wrapper in Python.
* `if` - An if statement, which is used to check if a condition is true.
* `else` - An else statement, which is used with `if`.
* `else if` - An else if statement, which is used with `if`.
* `for` - A for loop, which is used to loop through something till a condition is met. Two types of `for` loops are supported, `for (python for)` and `for (C for seperators are | not ;)`.
* `while` - A while loop, which is used to loop through something till a condition is met.
* `return` - A return statement, which is used to return a value from a function.
* `class` - A class, which is used to create a class.
* `struct` - A struct, which is used to create structures.

* `with` - A with statement, which is used to create a with statement.
* `async` - An async function, which is used to create an async function.
* `await` - An await statement, which is used to wait for an async function to finish.
* `coroutine` - A coroutine, which is used to create a coroutine. 4 types of coroutines are supported, `coroutine <functions> | ...`, `coroutine exec()`, `coroutine exec(function - Name | ...)`, `coroutine clear()`, `coroutine delete(function Name | ...)`, `coroutine auto_clear = <bool value>`.
* `const` - A constant, which is used to create a constant.
* `ref` - A reference, which is used to create a reference similar to the `global` keyword from python.
* `let` - A let statement, which is used to create a variable.
* `final` - A final variable, which is used to create a final variable. Final variables disallow any changes to the variable, and can only be accessed from within the local scope.
* `out` - Shows an output to the user through the console.
* `in` - A input statement, which is used to get input from the user.

* `finally` - A finally statement, which is used with `try`.
* `throw` - A throw statement, which is used to throw an error.
* `pyc` - A python code statement, which is used to run python code. Can also get python code from a file.
