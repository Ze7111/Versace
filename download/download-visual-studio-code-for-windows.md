You can also download the [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) version if you want to try out the latest features.

Versace does not specifically require VS Code, but it is the recommended editor for Versace, since it is the only editor that has the Versace extension for Syntax Highlighting.

### Step 2: Install VS Code

Follow the instructions on the VS Code website to install VS Code. Once you have completed the installation, you can move on to the next step.
