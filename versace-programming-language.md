### What is Versace?

Versace is a programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use. You can use it to make games, websites, and even apps!

### Who is Versace for?

In comparison to other programming languages, Versace is a lot easier to learn and use. This means that it is a great language for beginners to learn and use. It also has one of the best syntaxes out there, which means that it is a great language for people who are already experienced in programming to use. The error messages are also very helpful, to the point where you can learn from them.

### Our Goal

Our goal here at Versace is to make a programing language that is better than most other languages out there right now, it has the ease of use of Python, the speed of C, and the power of C++. All of this is packed into a language that is easy to learn and use. It also has a very good syntax, along with a compiler, transpiler, and interpreter. Versace is also a memory safe language, which means that you don't have to worry about memory leaks or other memory related issues. Versace is statically typed meaning that you have to define the type of a variable before you use it. But you can change the type of a variable at any time. This means that you can use the same variable for different things, but you can't use the same variable for different types of things. For example, you can't use the same variable for a string and a number. But you can use the same variable for a string and a list of strings. We also aimed to have very good error messages, which means that you can learn from them. We also have a very good documentation (hopefully), which means that you can learn from that too. On top of all of this, Versace is a programing language made by one person who is seventeen years old. This means that it is a very small project, but it is still a very good project. This also applies for the documentation and everything else, related to Versace.
